No Idle Help

If you have problems with your PC locking or going to sleep, No Idle will keep it awake. It works by simulating a key-press, so your machine thinks you're still working at the keyboard, so won't lock the screen or activate the screensaver.
No Idle works by simulating an F15 key up event. Of all the key presses available, F15 is probably the least intrusive (I've never seen a PC keyboard with that key!), and least likely to interfere with your work.

Settings:
Timer in Seconds (Optional): Default and minimum timer is set to 60 seconds.
Remind? (Optional): If this option is enabled, this will generate a Windows notification reminder about the app every 30 minutes.
Note: You can press enter key to start or stop the No Idle. This app opens on top of all windows, you can minimize the app by clicking the minimize button on the application window.
